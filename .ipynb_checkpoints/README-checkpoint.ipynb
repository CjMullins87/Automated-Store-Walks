    "# Automated Store Walks:  A Model With Available Data\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "Store level retail in grocery is easy to oversimplify. Succinctly, you just have to ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the product on the shelf?\n",
    "2. If yes, look at the next product.\n",
    "3. If no, put the proudct on the shelf and move on to the next product.\n",
    "\n",
    "As real and simple as this process is, it obscures the nuances that actually *get* product onto the sales floor. It doesn't ask whether the product was ordered; it doesn't ask whether the warehouse has run out; it doesn't ask whether the vendor is out of stock or whether they've been in for the day; it doesn't ask whether there are issues related to overnight replenishment - it just asks:  is it on the shelf?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an answer to this question, operators have created multiple tools to assist with inventory management. However, no tool generated to date has come as close to answering the question as well or as reliably as simply inspecting the sales floor. This is often time and labor intensive:  investing in a detail walk of every UPC on a sales floor is tedious; and often as a manager you need to anticipate multiple interruptions. Frequently, only a percent of the sales floor can be detail walked. So, as a manager, you have to make a judgment call about how and where to invest the time you have to maximize your return.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Baring this in mind, tools that can effectively point out potential sales floor issues are a great way for a manager or hourly assosciate to maximize their efficiency. Tools that are frequently in use force us to zero in on big sales and gross profit drivers. Other niche application tools can help us highlight unique shelf issues, such as displays; but there's still no substitute for walking the store in full detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, in this project I aim to take simple sales and inventory data from BI to create a model which can effectively flag shelf issues."
