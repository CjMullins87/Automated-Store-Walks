# Capstone Project

Retail genchat:

* Biggest cost is labor
* Increasing competition from all sides
* Sales floor automation can decrease labor and drive sales

HEB genchat:

* HEB is the largest private employer in Texas, local grocer
* Faces competition from Amazon/Whole Foods
* Has beaten out competitors like Kroger, Randall's, etc
* Relies on high labor expense: lots of store leadership; lots of salary managers; $15/hr for hour partners
* No salesfloor automation
* Databases that don't talk to each other

Store ops:

* Redundant store walks, often incomplete, by multiple parties with the same permission to alter counts but without the same total knowledge
* A tool that evaluates patterns in the data that could help identify issues in the store and correct/flag them for leaders/managers could significantly boost sales and reduce labor cost by pointing to immediate issues

Goal:

* To develop a tool that can flag issues, using the same techniques we use in store
